### Introduction
<b>Simple saving system (SSS)</b> - This is an easy way to save data from a class to a file, and using Packer.dll encrypt it with the XOR algorithm. That's all it takes: Clone this repository, create an object of the Player class (as an example) and use the Obfuscator class to specify the path to the file to be encrypted.It must first be created through the DataSaveModel class.

#### Using Web browser

### How to use
1. Go to the `Saving` folder and open the project (`.sln`) in Visual Studio.

3. Go to the `Saving/Debug` folder and run the program.
4. You should have a file `player.save` which will already be encrypted.
